			Welcome to my website!  My name is Jaylesh Patel (call me Jay for short).  I am an aspiring full-stack web developer and am currently enrolled in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.  If you're interested in my "origins story", then here it is:  I graduated from Rutgers Business School in 2013 with degrees in finance and supply chain management.  After a few years in the supply chain field, I decided to change careers and pursue a long-held interest of mine: coding!
		</p>

			Apart from coding, I do have other interests.  I enjoy hiking, running, reading, keeping up to date with events in both politics and tech, and travelling.  I've been to quite a few countries already (the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Malaysia, India, Singapore...to name a few).
